 - Value comparison type.
 -
 - Match can been used to construct rich comparisons that can themselves be
 - compared.
 -
 - Example:
 -
 -      -- While you can't do this:
 -      cmpA = (== 5)
 -      cmpB = (== 5)
 -      cmpA == cmpB   -- This will fail!  No instance for Eq (a -> a)
 -
 -      -- You can do this:
 -      cmpA = Exactly 5
 -      cmpB = Exactly 5
 -      cmpA == cmpB
 -
 -      -- Then go on to use the comparison:
 -      5 ~= cmpA
