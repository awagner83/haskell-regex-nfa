NFA Regular Expression Library (for Haskell)
============================================

This library is my attempt at an NFA-based regular expression engine.  Loosely
based on [Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast] [1], this is
mostly an experiment for me to understand/explore the implementation of regular
expression engines (particularly NFA-style).
